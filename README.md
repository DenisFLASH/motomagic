## MotoMagic

A data software for detecting anomalies in motorbike rider behavior.
Being aware of anomalies and alerting a rider if something unusual happens in his riding behaviour (comparing to his usual style) can significantly increase rider's safety.

Examples of unusual behavior that can be dangerous:
* "road rush"
* "lost in gaze"
* ...etc...

#### Data source
Rider's smartphone fixed to his bike produces sensor data of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetoscope etc.
This data is being collected.

#### Anomaly detection
Anomaly detection algorithm is used to attribute score (level of anomaly) to blocks of sensor data.
